## Project Description
The objective of this project was to create an application that enables developers create notes regardless of internet connectivity. Without internet, the application will utilize the `Service Worker` functionality to render cached data. These notes will be saved and easily retrieved when required. The project utilizes a *client-server* folder structure to run the application. 

The application was built as a Progressive Web Application utilizing several packages including Webpack. It also incorporated several other packages including but not limited to the following: `html-webpack-plugin`, `babel-loader`, `css-loader`, `idb`, `webpack-pwa-manifest`, `workbox-webpack-plugin` e.t.c. The server-side utilized `exress.js`.
